## Notes to reviewer

I do cross archeticture requrement on not using classes and separating games.
The reason is that I do not know how to make code testable and in the same time
do not duplicate logic without using something like mine QABuilders.

Maybe I missing something.

If you think, that this reasoning is not correct and mine arch is bad, than
I will rewrite it.
